  intro:
    "Cloud Engineer with hands-on Azure Compute capacity and incident management experience on Microsoft's Global Capacity Team at LTIMindtree, combined with website and app operations experience from a high-traffic D2C ecommerce platform at Mamaearth (Honasa Consumer) — covering site/app performance, analytics (Power BI, GA4, Firebase), and cross-functional execution. That mix gives me both the technical grounding to support infrastructure and a practical, data-driven approach to improving digital products.",
  about: [
    "My background sits at the intersection of cloud infrastructure and digital operations. On Microsoft's Global Capacity Team at LTIMindtree, I troubleshot Azure Compute allocation failures, managed quota requests (RDQs) and incident cases (ICMs), and ran root cause analysis across Resource Groups, VM Scale Sets, and Availability Zones — all under SLA.",
    "Before that, I ran website and app operations for Mamaearth (Honasa Consumer Ltd.), a high-traffic D2C ecommerce platform — working across Power BI, GA4, Firebase, AppsFlyer, and MoEngage to monitor performance and partnering with engineering, marketing, and design to ship improvements. That combination gives me a practical read on both infrastructure reliability and digital growth.",
